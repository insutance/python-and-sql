```sql
-- 정답 코드
with clients as(
    select users_id
    from users
    where role='client' and banned ='No'
)
, drivers as(
    select users_id
    from users
    where role='driver' and banned ='No'
)
select request_at Day,
        round(sum(case when status like 'cancelled%' then 1 else 0 end)/count(request_at),2) as 'Cancellation Rate'
from trips
join clients on trips.client_id = clients.users_id
join drivers on trips.driver_id = drivers.users_id
where request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
group by request_at
```

### 설명
**Users 테이블을 client와 driver로 분리<br>**
banned가 Yes인 것은 빼기(계산할 때 필요없기 때문에)
```sql
with clients as(
    select user_id
    from users
    where role='client' and banned ='No'
)
, drivers as(
    select user_id
    from users
    where role='driver' and banned ='No'
)
```

**trips 테이블에 clients 테이블과 drivers 테이블을 join**
```sql
select *
from trips
join clients on trips.client_id = clients.users_id
join drivers on trips.driver_id = drivers.users_id
where request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'


/*

[3, 3, 12, 6, "completed", "2013-10-01", 3, 12], 
[4, 4, 13, 6, "cancelled_by_client", "2013-10-01", 4, 13],

[10, 4, 13, 12, "cancelled_by_driver", "2013-10-03", 4, 13]
*/
```

```sql
-- status가 cancalled로 시작한다면 숫자 1을 리턴
-- 리턴된 숫자의 합 = cancelled된 숫자의 합
-- 날짜별 총 요청 개수 = count(request_at)
